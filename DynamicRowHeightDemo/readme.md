# Dynamic Row Height Demo

This is a working demo written for my blog post [How To Enable Dynamic Row Heights With UITableViews On iOS 8 And Later](https://thomasbandt.com/how-to-enable-dynamic-row-heights-with-uitableviews-on-ios-8-and-later). It's build with Xamarin.iOS 8.10 and Xcode 6.3 (in June 2015).
